# ZooDirectory

This program mimics what a potential zoo directory would do. It allows a user to store, view, and access detailed information about different animals. The user can input the name, color, age, weight, and type (land, water, sky) of an animal. The program also allows the user to view a full list of animals currently stored in the directory and access detailed information about a specific animal by searching for its name. Additionally, the user can choose to exit the program and will be warned that all data will be lost in advance.


<h2> Usage </h2>

1. Run the program and you will be prompted with the following options:
  * Register a new animal
  * View current directory
  * See detailed information of an animal
  * Exit

2. If you select "Register a new animal", you will be prompted to enter the name, color, age, weight, and type of the animal.

3. If you select "View current directory", a list of all the animals currently stored in the directory will be displayed.

4. If you select "See detailed information of an animal", you will be prompted to enter the name of the animal you wish to learn more about. The program will then display the detailed information of the animal you searched for.

5. If you select "Exit", the program will close and remind you that all data will be lost.
